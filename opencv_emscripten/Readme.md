# OpenCV EMScripten
This is an installation of OpenCV without shared libraries. Meaning, that when you compile your program, the result is an standalone (unless you use other shared libraries). This is inspired by [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html) but trying to do some standalone compilation.
